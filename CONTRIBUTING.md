## Guide to Adding Functions
If you have ideas for adding functions to PyThings, make an Issue, and format it like so:
___
<h3>Function Capability</h3>
<p>Pythings Version: The version this was made for</p>
<p>Function Name: Name of Function</p>
<p>Class: Class this belongs in. You can make a new one.</p>
<p>Desc. of Function. Format it like I did in the README.</p>
<p>link to code. If you just have an idea but no code, ignore this</p>
___

## Guide to Testing
The only currently tested platform in Windows 11. If you are testing, the most critical classes are the PCTools class and the Images class. Test **ALL** the functions in those. I am currently looking to test on a Mac.
